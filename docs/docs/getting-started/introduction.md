# Introduction

**Posta** is a self-hosted, open-source email delivery platform that gives developers full control over their email infrastructure. It provides a developer-friendly REST API for sending emails, managing templates, tracking delivery, and monitoring analytics — all without relying on third-party services like SendGrid or Mailgun.

## Why Posta?

- **Self-hosted** — Your data stays on your servers. No vendor lock-in.
- **Developer-first** — Clean REST API with official SDKs for Go, PHP, Java, and .NET.
- **Full-featured** — Templates with versioning and localization, SMTP management, domain verification, webhooks, analytics, and more.
- **Open source** — Licensed under AGPL-3.0. Contribute, fork, or customize as needed.

## API Reference

Every Posta instance serves its own interactive API documentation:

- **API Reference** — `/docs` on your Posta instance
- **OpenAPI spec** — `/openapi.json` on your Posta instance

Running locally with the default port, that is [http://localhost:9000/docs](http://localhost:9000/docs).

## Architecture

Posta ships as a single binary that runs in two modes: `posta` serves the HTTP
API, dashboard, and SMTP listeners, while `posta worker` consumes the job queue.
Both are stateless, with all state in PostgreSQL, Redis, and optional object
storage, so workers scale out horizontally.

See [Architecture](/docs/getting-started/architecture) for the full picture —
what each process does, how the queues are split, and how to deploy them.
