package routes

// Route paths registered by more than one definition, typically the GET, PUT,
// and DELETE of a single resource. They are named rather than repeated so a
// change to one method's path cannot leave the others behind, which would turn
// into a 404 on exactly one verb.
//
// They live together because goconst counts occurrences per package, not per
// file, and several are shared across route files.
